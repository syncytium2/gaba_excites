# Roadmap

What is deliberately NOT in v0.1, and the order it is likely to arrive in.
The owner's words are quoted where the item came from them.

## Next

- **Plug-and-play channels, and an interface to edit them.** "Future versions
  should have plug and play channels, and edit interface. For now just stock."
  The seam is already there: every channel implements the `Channel` interface
  in `src/core/channels.ts` (gates, a Rush–Larsen `advance`, an open fraction,
  and a steady-state open fraction for the Rin solve), and the integrator loops
  over whatever list it is given. What is missing is (1) a channel *description*
  format — rate functions or steady-state/tau curves as data, not code — that
  a UI can edit and that can be validated; (2) a library beyond the stock
  three (Ih, T-type Ca, persistent Na, A-type K, SK/BK with a calcium pool);
  (3) the editor itself, with live plots of m∞/τ(V); (4) a guard that every
  shipped channel still reproduces its source (the NEURON oracle, generalized).
- **Repeated trials and firing probability.** With membrane noise on, a step
  near rheobase fires on some trials and not others. Run each step N times,
  and plot spike probability and mean ± SD rate against current. Held back
  for now at the owner's request ("hold on the measurement"), along with a
  switch to measure on the recorded trace instead of Vm.
- **More GnRH parameter sets.** Adams et al. 2018 also fit positive feedback
  (OVX+E PM) and OVX; its Figs. 7–8 give the distributions. Each would be a
  model entry plus a test against the paper.
- **Voltage clamp**, with the same electrode model (Rs, prediction/correction).
  The brief said "current clamp only, to begin with".

## Later

- Shareable state: encode every setting in the URL hash so a configuration can
  be sent as a link (no server needed).
- Dendrites (a second compartment) so that where inhibition lands matters.
- Chloride dynamics, so that E_GABA can move with activity instead of being a
  parameter.
- NMDA (voltage-dependent Mg²⁺ block) and GABA-B.
- A card for this site on tonydefazio.com.
